# Developing a Modern MVC Architecture with PHP and Eloquent

## 📅 **Project Context**  
In modern web application development, a well-structured **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture is essential for ensuring clear separation of responsibilities, better maintainability, and extensibility of the code.  

This project aims to build a **lightweight PHP framework**, inspired by best practices, while remaining fast, simple, and easy to use. It will cater to modern application needs with minimal dependencies but will offer powerful features such as:  
- Routing management,  
- Integration with **Eloquent ORM**,  
- A secure data validation system.

## 💡 **Project Objectives**  
1. 🔹 Develop a clear and modular **MVC** architecture.  
2. 🔹 Implement a **custom router** to handle application URLs.  
3. 🔹 Secure integration with **Eloquent ORM** for database management.  
4. 🔹 Ensure **data security** against **XSS**, **CSRF**, and **SQL Injection** attacks.  
5. 🔹 Provide useful tools: data validation, session management, error handling.  
6. 🔹 Functionally separate the **Front Office** and **Back Office**.  
7. 🔹 Use **Composer** for class autoloading.

## ✅ **Key Features**  
- Advanced routing management.  
- Database connection via **Eloquent ORM**.  
- Separation between **Front Office** and **Back Office**.  
- Secure authentication system with user permissions.  
- **Role-based access control (ACL)** management.  
- Protection against **SQL Injection**, **XSS**, **CSRF**.  
- Utility classes: Validator, Security, Session.  
- Dynamic autoloading with Composer.

## ⚖️ **Best Practices to Follow**  

### 1. Strict Separation of Responsibilities  
- **Front Office**: Public-facing section accessible to all users.  
- **Back Office**: Restricted to authenticated administrators.  

### 2. Data Security  
- CSRF protection using **secure tokens**.  
- User input validation with **Validator.php**.  
- Protection against **XSS** and **SQL Injection** attacks using **Security.php**.  

### 3. Modularity  
- Use of abstract classes for code reusability.  
- Easy integration with other databases.  

### 4. Advanced Session and Authentication Management  
- Session management via **Session.php**.  
- User authentication via **Auth.php**.  

### 5. Autoloading with Composer  
- Create a `composer.json` file to manage dependencies.
